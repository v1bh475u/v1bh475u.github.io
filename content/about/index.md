## About Me

Hi! I'm `vibhatsu`, a student at IIT Roorkee who enjoys exploring technology. I'm particularly interested in understanding how computers work at a fundamental level.

My explorations have led me to develop a keen interest in low-level programming, systems programming and security. I'm also interested in learning about the design and implementation of programming languages.

Currently, I am learning about operating systems and theory of computation.

I am a big fan of open-source software and I try to contribute to projects whenever I can. I also enjoy writing about my experiences and learnings on this blog.

You can find more about me at [GitHub](https://github.com/v1bh475u) and my [resume](../about/Resume.pdf).
