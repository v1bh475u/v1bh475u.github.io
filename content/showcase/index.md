## [Debugger](https://github.com/v1bh475u/Debugger)
- Designed and implemented a custom debugger for Linux binaries from scratch in modern C++, leveraging
the ptrace system call for process control and debugging, similar to its use in GNU Debugger. The project
includes a structured design with proper namespace management to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- Tools Used: C++, Linux ManPages


## [Fix8](https://github.com/v1bh475u/Fix8)
- Collaborated with teammates on a course project to design a Turing-complete 8-bit Instruction Set Archi-
tecture (ISA) with fixed 8-bit instruction lengths. Implemented support for conditional logic, loops, and
basic arithmetic operations, employing clever techniques to maximize functionality within strict length con-
straints. Developed an assembler and emulator to enable accurate translation and execution of instructions.
- Tools Used: C++

## [CServe](https://github.com/v1bh475u/CServe)
- Developed a simple HTTP server in C that supports GET and POST requests, serving static files and dynamic
content.
- Tools Used: C

## [MVC-LMS](https://github.com/v1bh475u/MVC)
- Written in Go, it uses the Go html template engine to render pages with MySQL as the database.
It is a full fledged Library manager with features including JSON Web Tokens, secure routes, password
hashing. Is completely Dockerized with Docker Compose along with config files for Apache to virtually host
on your computer.
- Tools Used: Golang, Apache, MySQL, Docker, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
