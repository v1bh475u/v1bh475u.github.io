- Built a distributed file system with thread-safe caching and synchronized concurrent access.
- Implemented ECDH-based key exchange and AES-GCM encryption for secure communication.
- Added Zlib compression and an LRU cache layer to improve throughput.
- Designed Protobuf-based message protocol for client-server interaction.
- Tools Used: C++, CMake, GitHub Actions, Protobuf, CryptoPP, zlib, spdlog

## [cielc](https://github.com/v1bh475u/ciel)
- Developed a full compiler translating a custom C++-like language to RISC-V assembly
- Built the front-end (lexer, parser, semantics) using Flex and Bison.
- Generated optimized 3AC supporting classes, inheritance, lambdas and automated lifetime handling.
- Tools Used: C++, CMake, GitHub Actions, Flex, Bison, RISC-V Docs

## [Debugger](https://github.com/v1bh475u/Debugger)
- Designed and implemented a custom debugger for Linux binaries from scratch in modern C++, leveraging
the ptrace system call for process control and debugging, similar to its use in GNU Debugger. The project
includes a structured design with proper namespace management to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- Tools Used: C++, Linux ManPages

## [gbemu](https://github.com/sdslabs/gbemu)
- Refactored APU subsystem to separate synthesis logic from callbacks.
- Implemented accurate timing and channel mixing following Pan Docs specs.
- Improved maintainability with clearer subsystem boundaries.
- Tools Used: C++, SDL2, Pan Docs
